You sent in a solution that does not work quite correctly according 
to our automatic checks. Because of this, the submit has been marked 
as insufficient. You can re-submit it up until the deadline.

Note that the checks usually require your programs to have the exact
name that is required in the submit form. If you have submitted a file
using the wrong name, just rename it and try again!
