# A Very Simple Program

This problem set will introduce you to the programming environment IDLE and to programming in Python, as well as to our general problem set structure. 

In this problem set, you will install IDLE, write a simple Python program, and hand it in. Be sure to read this problem set thoroughly, especially the sections of Collaboration and the Hand-in Procedure.

## Collaboration

You may work with other students. However, each student should write up and hand in his or her assignment separately. Be sure to indicate with whom you have worked. For further detail, please review the collaboration policy as stated in the course information handout.

## Installing Python and IDLE

Follow the steps in [Getting Python](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Getting_Python) for installing Python and IDLE onto the machine you plan to be using this term.

Familiarize yourself with Python and IDLE using the exercises given in the handout. Once you are ready, proceed to the programming part of this assignment.

Note, when you first start using your system, make sure that the version number displayed is not 3.0 or higher. That version of Python is not backwards compatible with 2.5.4, which is the official Python version used in this course.

## Entering and Printing Your Name

The goal of this programming exercise is simply to get you more comfortable with using IDLE, and to begin using simple elements of Python. Standard elements of a program include the ability to print out results (using the print operation), the ability to read input from a user at the console (for example using the raw_input or input function), and the ability to store values in a variable, so that the program can access that value as needed.

### Problem 1

Write a program that does the following in order:

* Asks the user to enter his/her date of birth.
* Asks the user to enter his/her last name.
* Prints out the user’s last name and date of birth, in that order.

An example of an interaction with your program is shown below (the words printed in blue are from the computer, based on your commands, the words in black are a user’s input – the colors are simply here to help you distinguish the two components):

    Enter your date of birth:
    **01/26/32
    Enter your last name:
    **Grimson
    Grimson 01/26/32

### Hints

To see how to use the print command, you may find it convenient to look at the [input and output](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Input_and_output) section of the Python Wikibook. This will show you how to use print statements to print out values of strings.

To see how to read input from a user’s console into the Python environment, you may find it convenient to look at the same section (see for example the raw_input or input function).

Remember that if you want to hold onto a value, you need to store it in a variable (i.e., give it a name to which you can refer when you want that value). You may find it convenient to look at the [variables and strings](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Variables_and_Strings) section of the Python Wikibook.
